## Summary

I became interested in web development when I was on maternity leave. I started to dive into layout a little and realized that I wanted to do it professionally. I really enjoyed studying web development and then I signed up for professional courses which I successfully completed with a diploma and several projects in my portfolio.

For some time after completing the courses, I was doing an internship as a junior front-end developer. I have also completed several personal pet projects. I try to keep up with modern web development trends, read professional articles, textbooks, and listen to podcasts.
